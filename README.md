##CatchTheCards
This is my first attempt at a Unity game.

To run the download the CatchTheCards.exe and run.
The game will only work properly if Windowed is selected.

The object is to catch the cards of the displayed suit, using the arrow keys(Left and Right).
Every 5 seconds you get some points, more points awarded for catching the right card.
You are giving 5 lives, a life is deducted if you catch the wrong card.

All code used is in the Assets/Scripts folder
